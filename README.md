## Introduction
The Semi-Autonomous Vehicle is based on how Cordel.AI has taken advantage of Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence to survey infrastructure without human error and time. The job assigned to us is to take their principle of “if you can see it, so can an AI” with a constraint of a box of hardware supplied by The University of Newcastle ENGG1500, to develop a Semi-Autonomous Vehicle able to use sensors to navigate a custom track made by Dr Dylan Cuskelly.
